Students of different trimesters need to select courses of their own choice in an open credit
university. They need to choose their selections against each course on their own from the
university provided section list, the process is known as ”Advising”. It is very burdensome
and also stressful for students to create a suitable class routine manually. Most of the time,
two or more classes conflict with one another, which makes it impossible to register for
both and also the universities have to develop a fixed schedule for courses with limited
capacity. As a result, students can not take their desired section, and sometimes they
even have to drop the course. To reduce the complexity of the advising, we will develop
Automated Class Schedule Allocation method. Our system will analyze collected data
and will generate an optimal class schedule based on student time preference.
